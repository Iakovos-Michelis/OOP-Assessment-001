Assignment 2: This Java application implements the classic Hangman game. Users can register or log in, and after authentication, a random word is provided from an API. The word is displayed with only the first and last letters revealed, while the player guesses letters. Players have up to 6 wrong guesses before the game ends. After each game, users can choose to play again or logout. Upon logout, their score is updated in the database, and a leaderboard feature displays the top players.
